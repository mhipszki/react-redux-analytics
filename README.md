# Analytics in a React / Redux Single Page App

## Synopsis

Have you implemented Analytics before in a React / Redux app? Did you find it easy or difficult? How was the collaboration between UI and Analytics folks? Was it simple to scale or a headache? Getting analytics right in a scalable way can be harder than expected. We discuss why analytics is important, how it works end to end and what the challenges we might face along the way are.
